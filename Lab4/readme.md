## Goal
The goal of this work is to compare and face brute force algorithms with greedy algorithms for the problem of find the roots of a polynom
## complexity
Taking n as the size of the interval for find the answer the complexity of the brute force algorithm is O(n), for other size taking as a reference the time complexity of binary search trees we can get intuetively a complexity of O(log(n)) for the bisection algorithm, given that in some degree we are doing a binary search.
